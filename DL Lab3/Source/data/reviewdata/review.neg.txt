The reviews were right.
Terrible gas off with this product!!!
Fire Retardants! STAY AWAY!
Waste of Money :(
Not worth the extra money...
I loved this, but it is made of polyurathane which is not healthy for your baby

Buy Freddie the Firefly instead

Disappointed
My child loves it - but the quality is mediocre at best

Ridiculous
Defective one?
Not what you think...
Not a good teether, the paint rubs off.
Stangulation Hazard
fun for a while, then the rubber comes apart

Soft seat is a sponge for urine!
Made in China
These spoons are NOT made in the USA

U-G-L-Y
HOW on EARTH does this have so many good reviews?!

Toys? What toys?
Could be different for others
So scary- baby fell on his head!
Baby loved it....but, we realized how harmful it is!
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE??

Save your money and go straight to a convertible car seat.
It may be rated "safest" but...
get something else
Bulky and cumbersome
Hard to Handle, Not Worth the Money
Not the greatest stroller
Great for playing, not great for packing
hmm...
Not what I expected
Looks cheap and it attracts dust/hair
Buy the Madela
Disappointing quality but helpful after sales service
No suction!
Not for long term...Limited lifespan
HORRIBLE!  Designed by a man, I'm sure.  Buy a Medela.

BPA Free but poor design.  Better BPA-free options if you look
BPA Free but a BAD DESIGN and WASTE OF MONEY
Waste of money
My son is not a fan of these spouts...
Good idea, lousy execution
Expensive & poorly designed - LOTS of better BPA free options now
The spout is not big enough
leaks & that annoying "vent"
Impossible to get fluid out
Threw mine away ...
Horrible - stick to regular brushes ...
Split easily.  Overpriced!!!  Shop around for less expensive BPA free options
Child needs to be bigger for us to be able to use this.

Horrible Material!
Not recommended
Don't bother - good concept - but not useful as executed in this product!
Dumb
Box was not 20-- there were only 8
Not Really Neccessary
Doesn't hold in place
The Hinge Rusts
these are dumb
Not my preference
Dangerous/defective??
IMHO: useless
Super Cute and Soft but Sheds HORRIBLY
We were so looking forward to this gift ... but..
I *so* wanted to like this...
not washable and contains PVC
Returned it without use
Don't Bother
I'll compromise and take a healthier mattress...
Needs a more secure top
over priced
Not a great cleaner.
Sizes are all off and it feels insecure
Uncomfortable
Hate it
Great idea but poorly executed
Disappointing.
Love the regular K'tan, just not the breeze
Nice but not for us
did not feel secure
Perhaps I purchased the wrong size?
Sizing is way off.
Great concept, just didn't work for me
Doesn't Seem Safe
Not For Newborns
Fit is awkward.  Baby screams in it.
Not a fan
Couldn't get it on or baby in it
Horrible waste of money
Would have been great if all parts came with it
Baby hated it
Sent it Back
Not for me too hard to use
Too complicated and doesn't feel very secure
Complicated
Sizes run too small
Too small and too big!
Piznump
Didn't end up using it
Very heavy - not good for travelling
What a nightmare - missing parts, company useless
nothing too special, doesn't provide enough shade
Works, but...

Works if you never want to use the outlet again
Bad fit
Opening to small
Great idea, but issues

It's ok

Keep Looking
Wretched.
Great design, but needs vast improvement.
Difficult for babies to figure out
Doesn't leak, easy to hold, hard to drink from and clean
Nice in theory but not practical for a few reasons
Not worth it

Get a different snack container.
Not impressed by the utensils

Does not "humidify"
Beautiful, but didn't work for our baby

These arent what they used to be
Get the stroller blanket

Broken in less than 30 days
I want to love this product, but....
Be aware - monitor froze!
Comparing Lorex BB2411 with Lorex WL2002W
Just couldn't make it work for us
Not worth the money
can't figure this out
Hate it
This is not a great product
Mangled Box makes an embarassing present
Fine but just not for us
Fasteners that hold baby in seat are very small
Expensive for such limited functionality
Marginal video monitor. I can barely see my child.
Not good quality at all
Audio is great, low-light video is poor
Not worth the $!
Chunky image, color off, shorter battery life
Broken after 1 week of use
Poorly made, bad quality materials, broke within few days.
Not recommended.
Toxic
Know your baby before you buy
Don't bother
Traveling plastic placemat
Poor product
Don't Waste your money
If Given the Chance this Baby Will Leak
Great Idea, Failed Delivery
i think it gave my baby colics.
Hard time
Very mixed feelings about this item...
Not for Us
Not as great as I hoped
Pretty to look at but not very useful for feeding babies.
should have listened to the reviews
Not a must have for tummy sleepers
Annoying
Creaks loudly
Good for daytime, but horrible for night time
OK, But I'd Recommend an IP Camera Instead
Did NOT like them at al.
good concept but not designed well
Doesn't seem to hold much
Don't know how it worked...came to me defective.
Not great
Leaks every time
Does not work in any outlet in our places
Color not as pictured!
Too loose and flimsy.
Poor quality
Not worth it.
Cheap
Too flimsy
Prince Lionheart royally screws up the design of a simple potty
Terrible, a huge downgrade from the original
Battery life sucks
A little flimsy and, unfortunately, baby hated it
Can't get spare parts
How to store pumped milk with this pump?? Major oversight.
Small, cheap diaper.
Buy Medela Product instead
IT HAD POTENTIAL!
If you are used to medelas shield/flange sizes be careful when ordering these-size up maybe?
Extra silicone pieces on the front edge, dangerous.
Poorly designed, clumsy stroller does little well; excellent car seat
Good carseat, jenky stroller
not satisfied
Complete Waste of Money
had to send it back
I hate these bags
These are a waste of money
7 layers but thinner
I despise this product
Maybe Just My Baby
Its ok at best.
Great in theory, but practice could use a little work.
Great in theory, not in reality
My baby hates it
Buy a different chair
So much worse than any other Britax seat I've ever used
Car seat number 10 for my kid UPDATE 2. HORRIBLE!
not my favorite!
Disappointed
Baby Shusher waste of money
Slight disappointment.
Seams pull apart, twice!
Started pilling on first wash
Very poor quality!
Love Avent, but not this bottle.
Very impressed with the quality. Great storage! UPDATE: coming apart.
Updated review- returning the S1
Lacks a lot.
Cute-but not functional on Joovy Caboose Sit and Stand
Terrible purchase
Great Camera, BUT...
This pouch is supposed to hold wipes? But it gets wet on the outside!
Cute but not worth the money
Please read!! I wish I picked a different brand!! AMAZON IS AMAZING THOUGH!!!
Terrible audio and video quality
No Range
Small
Wearing out in less than 2 months!
Copied Lovelace!
My daughter would constantly sweat in this thing.
Not thrilled with it
Disappointing
Lousy
Disappointed
Lame
Not air tight, so the wipes dry out...
Wipes dry out, the whole purpose of a wipe box is to keep them moist.
Boutique style at a fraction of the cost.
Hard to clean.
I should have just bought a table cloth
About 7" short on the crib rail
Not the least bit waterproof.
Poor design and quality
Got only two stars in my comparison test
Interrupts My Home Network
Very basic and very over priced
Not enough recline
Not Remotely Impressed So Far
Not enough foot space, not worth the money
Where did all the negative reviews go?
Awesome food pouches!  ((EDIT!))
Really wanted to love them.
When it worked, it was great, but it got clogged and made my baby sick
Mine does not work - battery or worse?
Good in theory, if it wasn't glitchy. Snuza was better.
Silly crocodile
Piles badly even after 3 washes
Avent took a big step backwards with this newer model!
Follow-up, Follow-up, Follow-up; Warranty Service Depends on the CSR ...  Unit Died After Only 9 Months ...
I hate this monitor
This is so close to being the perfect monitor but for one fatal flaw -
Not worth it.
Too small to be useful, edges curl up
defective
Fell apart during first wash/ dry.
Why Are These Straws Now $21????
not very durable
Color is pretty but&#8230;
Has flame retardant TB117 label, back in the box it goes
Bad idea
I love this seat!
SHAME on Fisher-Price and Amazon
Worst thing you could do to your baby
WOW
Crazy
poor audio
Deal breaker
NOT a bedside monitor and not interference free with your Internet WIFI
You are likely not going to use it
Not much of a turtle
Idea is cute, but has very sharp corners
Dont let your kids who are teething use
thought i was getting more teethers
misleading
BEWARE: While the company claims that the "safest" materials are used, this is not true, as I have discovered...frustrating!!
design flaw inhibits proper function
Too Soft For Me and Pillow Case is Annoying to Put On.
Just fine, but not amazing
Returned it!
What a piece of crap!
I wanted to love them because of the snaps.
Not impressed at all
I think it's flimsy
Don't stick to the walls well
Lousy, don't buy it!!
Horrible. Avoid this system.
Just not worth the price
A bigger pain than it's worth
Ugh. Not pleased at all
Junk
Not a good fit for my stash. Will not buy again. :(
complicated
Not good for brick fireplaces
For very wide-hipped babies...
Does not hold what it says it does.
Just okay.  Seems cheap.
Quite functional and intuitive, but feels like they prioritized the wrong features
It's ok....
Bummer
Line Dry or it Melts.  Oh and you can't machine wash it, ever.
Not for cloth diapers!
Frustrated with rear-facing option
Britax Boulevard G4 vs Chicco Nextfit 2nd Generation for rear facing babies
Not for short people
These things just don&#8217;t work&#8230;
Wanted to love this But did not
Wish I read the reviews
waaaay too small for my 11 month-old.
Extremely Flimsy
Useless
Not better than holding the pump yourself
Waste of money!
Too complicated
complicated
Unfortunately, not for me
Fiddly, overpriced fashion over function
worst care seat!!! not worth the money!
Not practical, hard to belt in without smart hub.
VERY overpriced for a pack'n'play sheet!
Not Digging This.
Ehh...
1 Count in Two Count Package
Mediocre IP camera for a steep price
Really cute, but very flimsy
Buy the old version
Was recalled
Haven't Used it Yet
Not great compared to other newborn drying racks
Serves it's purpose.
Not a fan
Not a hit
Didn't work
Annoying!
The Concept of this Product is Great but it Doesn't Work!!
Changed my mind!
Poor execution
Works pretty good
Hate it!
I don't think I'd be happy with any of these types of products
Tiny size and bad clip design offset usefullness
jiggled to much for me
Was so excited, then so let down
Fussy
Didn't work for me
Many flaws, expensive, doesn't pack easily
Doesn't work...returned for refund
Leaky bottle
wanted to love these
Not worth the $$$
Poor Design, $$$
Way too small!
The spoon is amazing!
Lots of great individual pieces but it's a strange mix
Poor quality control, and not age appropriate.
Poor camera design makes getting a good angle close to impossible.
Hard to blow up! Very light weight.
Hate the shower
Eeh.  Janky design.  Very hard to setup.  No instruction manual.  Very confusing settings controls.  Good picture though.
Honestly, I'm not sure it's safe.
insulated cup sadly not a keeper
Deplorable fabric quality!
Nice design, but dribbles everywhere
Nipple easily collapses, frustrates baby!
Venting a plus, nipple collapses easily.
Didn't work with our Inglesina
Dont buy, it is too hard to fasten straps
had some problems
it was great at rocking him to sleep so we could more ...
This is the worst thing I've ever bought.
Battery died sometime in the night after a full charge
Spend more on a proven alternative.
Do not work.
Not worth the money
WARNING: May not install properly Rav 4 2010 (2005-2012 model)
